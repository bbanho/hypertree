# Hypertree

Hypertree is a context-aware AI assistant deeply integrated with the Hyprland window manager. It aims to streamline development workflows by providing intelligent code generation, execution, and automation.

## Core Features

*   **Contextual Code Generation:** Generates code snippets based on the active window and clipboard content.
*   **Smart Execution:** Infers the execution context (e.g., bash, python) and provides a safe execution environment.
*   **Autofix Mode:** Captures terminal errors and suggests automatic corrections.
*   **Multimodal Integration:** Interprets screenshots to provide context-aware assistance.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Learns from user interactions to improve suggestions.

## Project Structure

*   `docs/`: Project documentation.
*   `scripts/`: Helper scripts for context capture and execution.
*   `src/`: Python source code for the daemon and related modules.
